# Git commande
## Commit
When using git commit, keep the message short and descriptive. Syntax for commit messages should be "Fixes bug #1234". instead of "Implemented a fix for bug #1234". Before committing, ask if the commit is related to a specific issue or feature and in case it is, add the provided issue number to the commit message.

IMPORTANT: Always use English for commit messages, never Swedish or other languages.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT add Claude Code attribution or co-authored-by lines to commit messages. Keep commits clean and concise.

# Code Style Rules
IMPORTANT: NEVER add trailing whitespaces after lines or whitespace-only lines. This applies to ALL projects FOREVER. When writing or editing code:
- No trailing whitespaces at the end of lines
- No lines that contain only whitespace characters
- Empty lines should be completely empty with no spaces or tabs

# Solution Approach
IMPORTANT: Always push back when the user has an idea that seems overly complex. Keep solutions as simple and maintainable as possible. If a simpler solution exists, suggest it first before implementing complex workarounds. Question whether the complexity is really needed and propose alternatives that are easier to maintain.
