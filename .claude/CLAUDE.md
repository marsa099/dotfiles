# Git commande
## Commit
When using git commit, keep the message short and descriptive. Syntax for commit messages should be "Fixes bug #1234". instead of "Implemented a fix for bug #1234". Before committing, ask if the commit is related to a specific issue or feature and in case it is, add the provided issue number to the commit message.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT add Claude Code attribution or co-authored-by lines to commit messages. Keep commits clean and concise.
